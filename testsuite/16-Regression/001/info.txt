Hallo Roman,

could you please have a look at the attached program?

There are two problems with it:

1) changing line 17 from (myCol.Count-1) to (myCol.Count) gives the compiler error [17,15] [2050] Illegal type Int32 of the to-expression in the for-statement

2) changing line 20 from System.Console.Write to write gives the compiler error:
[16,10] [2050] Illegal type Object of the argument for 'write/writeln' 

Is this the behaviour correct?
