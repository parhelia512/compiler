Dear Roman,

thank you for your reply, some days ago, relating some installation problems with Zonnon 1.10.

The new release 1.11 for Visual Studio 2008 has been a bit better. But the most installation problems still remained.

The most of this problems could be solved, so that I could give you some constructive feedback.

1.) the *setup needs administator rights* (for gacutil and regasm), but this is never proved during the installation process. *Running gacutil.exe and regasm *with Windows Vista Home Premium *needs administator rights*. Even without administrator rights the installation is declared to be sucessfull.
But this is confusing.

_Solution:_ It would be better to rollback the installation, when there are no admin rights.

The compilation problems in Visual Studio 2008 seemed to be associated with errormessages,  caused when running integrate2008.bat.

2.) *Gacutil.exe could not be found* anywhere on my computer. May be that the installation of Visual Studio 2008 was incomplete. The Zonnon setup expects gacutil.exe in the Zonnon-Home directory, but doesn't place a copy there.

_Solution:_ placing a copy of gacutil in the ZonnonHomeDirectory. It may be helpfull, when "gacutil.exe" is distributed with the zonnon package.

3.) with *activated UAC adding assemblies in the Global Assembly Cage is denied*.
For example:
...
D:\Languages\Zonnon 1.11>gacutil /nologo /i Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.dll
Failure adding assembly to the cache: Access denied. You might not have administrative credentials to perform this task. Contact your system administrator for assistance.

D:\Languages\Zonnon 1.11>gacutil /nologo /i Microsoft.VisualStudio.Designer.Interfaces.dll
Failure adding assembly to the cache: Access denied. You might not have administrative credentials to perform this task. Contact your system administrator for assistance.

D:\Languages\Zonnon 1.11>gacutil /nologo /i Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.dll
Failure adding assembly to the cache: Access denied. You might not have administrative credentials to perform this task. Contact your system administrator for assistance.

D:\Languages\Zonnon 1.11>gacutil /nologo /i Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.dll
Failure adding assembly to the cache: Access denied. You might not have administrative credentials to perform this task. Contact your system administrator for assistance.

_Solution:_ deactivating UAC and then  running integrate2008.bat as an admin.


4.) Missing two files:
...
D:\Languages\Zonnon 1.11>gacutil /nologo /i *System.Compiler.Sql.dll *
Failure adding assembly to the cache:   Das System kann die angegebene 
Datei nicht finden.

D:\Languages\Zonnon 1.11>gacutil /nologo /i 
*System.Compiler.Sql.Runtime.dll *
Failure adding assembly to the cache:   Das System kann die angegebene 
Datei nicht finden.
 
This two files were not included in the zonnon package and are still 
missing.

Nevertheless with the first 3 solutions running the Projecttemplates 
(Consoleapplication and Winformsapplication) within Visual Studio 2008 
was sucessfull.

So I'am very glad, that I could start exploring Zonnon now.
