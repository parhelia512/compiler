I found an interesting bug.  It provides the output:

al@shadowfax:~/Work/code/zonnon/biax/drivers/FreedEinsteinSacks$ mono /home/al/Work/code/zonnon/compiler/zc.exe optimizeIsoFES.znn /ref:/home/al/Work/code/zonnon/bin/Bel.dll /ref:/home/al/Work/code/zonnon/bin/FreedEinsteinSacks.dll /out:/home/al/Work/code/zonnon/bin/isoOptimize /entry:Driver

2151: /home/al/Work/code/zonnon/biax/drivers/FreedEinsteinSacks/optimizeIsoFES.znn(527,7): Delegate OptimizerModel arguments do not match requested: (Zonnon.Bel.MF.Arrays+Array _p01,Zonnon.Bel.MF.Matrices+Matrix _p11,System.Int32[] _p21)

Now, let me explain what I think is the cause.  What I have done is to define 
a procedure type.  It has three arguments.  The first two point to 'value'
types, the third to a 'ref' type; specifically, an array * of integer.
This procedure type was defined in the Bel.dll, and is being called from a 
module outside of Bel.dll.  If I make all the arguments use 'value' types,
then the code compiles and works.  If any of them is a 'ref' type, though, 
I get an error message similar to the one above.

I know you won't be fixing this until fall, after Nina is done.  I just
wanted to let you know so I wouldn't forget to tell you later.  

All the best,

Al
